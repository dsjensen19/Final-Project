# Final-Project

Okeydoke,So here's the way that the game is played. Conecpts first, then we make the final framework

So there is the pirate haven, an island where you start the game
in all directions, there is fog. The ocean is made up of various tiles
when you travel, you see through a certain number os squares of fog. These squares remain unfoggy
You find islands (several tiles large). when you sail to each square of the island, you loot that part
of the island for stuff (either just straight gold or various valuable things that can be sold for gold at pirate haven)
Every square you move costs supplies. You have a limited cargo hold for holding supplies and loot

you can upgrade cargo, crew, sight, cannons

end of game is falling off of the edge of the world

storm refills islands and resets fog
